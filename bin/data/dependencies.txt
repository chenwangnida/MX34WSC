Dependencies of OWLS-MX GUI
---------------------------
OWLS-MX GUI depends on several external libaries. Similar to the libaries OWLS-MX itself depends on, 
they are included  in each release. Most of these libaries are needed for displaying the graphs in
the result tab. Hence if you do not need these you can recompile the GUI without the libaries by
just removing the result tab (ResultVisualization).
